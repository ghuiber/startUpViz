startUpViz
==========

This is an excuse to use [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/) for something, and to practice using RStudio projects with Git version control using GitHub as the remote host. So I'm trying to do two, make that three things at a time: build a viz, save the R code and data as a stand-alone package, and integrate GitHub with RStudio.

The data set to visualize came from [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2014/10/09/the-top-100-enterprise-analytics-startups-of-2014/). It's an Excel file that I turned into a data frame.
