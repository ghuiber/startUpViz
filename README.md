startUpViz
==========

This is an excuse to use [rCharts](http://rcharts.io/) for something, and to practice using RStudio projects with Git version control using GitHub as the remote host. So I'm trying to do two, make that three things at a time: build a viz, save the R code and data as a stand-alone package, and integrate GitHub with RStudio.
